# pyCheckSum Calculator
Get the md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 hash sum of a file using a python script.

```
$ python pyCheckSum.py testFile.txt
```
## Output:
```
md5sum 70ab0fecde91d64788a7092caa4e58b5
sha1sum dc1507883fd97251c76dfae3b227a8c41a2aa9ab
```

## To DO:
Maybe instead of calculating all the check sum of a file using all these algorithm, I might wanna allow the user to choose which one to use.
